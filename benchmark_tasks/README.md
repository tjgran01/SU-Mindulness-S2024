### Benchmark Tasks.

The "Reaction_Time" variable in the data usually displays just that - the participant's reaction time during the trial, but there are a few cases in which in which the value reported in the reaction time column is not the participant's actual reaction time.

The table below shows what certain codes mean when they are encountered in participant data files.

| Coding  | Tasks Present  | Coding Variable  | Description |
|---|---|---|-
| -1  | Reaction_Time, Go_No_Go  | False Start | Participant entered response before stimulus was presented. (i.e. While focus was displayed) |
| 1  | Reaction_Time, Go_No_Go | Lapse | Participant did not enter a response during the stimulus period. |
| 0 | Go_No_Go | Correct 'No Go' | The participant correctly responded to the 'No Go' condition by *not* submitting a response. |
